Project Description: BunkMates


Living with the right people beats living on your own any day. When you live with the right people,
you don't just share your space - you share your life. They become more than your flatmates,
more than the people ahead of you in the queue for the bathroom. They're your friends.
BunkMates is all about helping you find those people. The people who make sharing amazing.

The Website will enable its user to find their roommates based upon their prefernces and priority. It will
let the users to get a list of people which can be their potential roommate based upon the matching algorithm.
Once matched both the person gets to connected together and if their plan allows then they can access the housing
space which can be used to find housing as their next step. The search for roommate is controlled on the basis of what 
plan the user is active in, which is divided into 4 categories and have increasing benefits on the increasing price end.
